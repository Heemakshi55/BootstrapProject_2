Building a website using Bootstrap v5 with Sass.

Step 1: Created all the Sass files(.scss) and worked on navbar:

We have _custom.scss file for the customized Sass using variables. Then we are using @use rule to call the custom.scss file  in style.scss to compile and the changes can be seen in style.css file. Moreover, we have two folders components (animations.scss, buttons.scss, mixins.scss, typography.scss)  and sections under scss folder.

For Navbar section, I have used bootstrap component Navbar and made some changes by adding some css, mixins and importing custom.scss file to use customised Sass and also made it responsive by adding media queries.
